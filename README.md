A professional, cross-platform desktop application built with Python and OpenCV for automatically blurring faces and manually tracking objects in videos to protect privacy. 

## ✨ Key Features
* **🤖 AI Face Detection:** Automatically scans the video and applies pixelation to human faces using Deep Learning models.
* **🎯 Smart Object Tracking:** Select any object manually (e.g., license plates, logos, documents) and the CSRT tracker will follow and blur it throughout the video.
* **🎨 Dual Shapes:** Choose between Square or Circular/Elliptical pixelation masks.
* **🌗 Dark Mode UI:** A clean, modern, and eye-friendly interface designed for video editors.
* **🌍 Bilingual Support:** Fully supports English and Arabic with dynamic RTL/LTR layout switching.
* **🎛️ Granular Controls:** Adjust detection confidence, memory frames, and pixelation strength in real-time.
